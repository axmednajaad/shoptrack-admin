---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React-based framework with SSR and API routes)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Auth, Storage, and APIs)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security for multi-tenancy
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (email/password login, tenant metadata)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (recommended for Next.js deployment)

---

## System Design

**Tables Overview:**

- `users` (managed by Supabase Auth)
- `products`
- `orders`
- `customers`
- `loans`
- `order_items`
- `expenses`

**Flow Example:**

1. Tenant logs in → `tenant_id` is retrieved from user metadata.
2. Tenant adds a customer → customer linked to `tenant_id`.
3. Tenant adds products → products linked to `tenant_id`.
4. Tenant creates an order for a customer → order items stored in `order_items`.
5. Tenant creates a loan → linked to customer and order if partially paid.
6. Tenant tracks expenses → independent financial tracking.

If you want, I can **also create a ready-to-use GitHub repository with this README, folder structure, and a Next.js + Supabase starter setup**, so you can start coding immediately without worrying about setup.

Do you want me to do that next?
